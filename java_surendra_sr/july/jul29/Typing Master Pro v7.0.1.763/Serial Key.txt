Optimal Learning - Better Skills in Less Time

At TypingMaster, we consider your time precious. That's why our team has developed a set of Optimal Learning features to accelerate your learning and save your time.

Optimal Learning features support your learning in many ways. When you see how you are making rapid progress and reaching your goals, you’ll be motivated to keep going. If weak spots are detected, they are eliminated immediately with customised exercises. After the typing course the unique TypingMaster Satellite integrates training into your everyday work.
The bottom line - you will acquire better typing skills in less time. 

Optimal Learning Features
Optimized Duration
Exercises Made to Measure

TypingMaster monitors your progress in real time as you do the typing drills. If your typing is accurate and fluent enough, the program lets you complete the drill in a shorter timespan. Similarly, it will provide more practice when you need it.

As a result the duration of each exercise is based on your personal learning needs so you’re likely to save a lot of unnecessary practice. Your overall skill level will also be better as weaknesses are addressed immediately with extended training.

Smart Review
Difficult Keys Eliminated

During training TypingMaster Pro monitors how well you master each key and visualises your progress in a graph. If one or more keys are particularly difficult, you’ll get a recommendation to train them with a fully tailored review exercise.

Additionally, you can review keys of your choice whenever you need. This way difficult keys are improved right away before they start to slow down your learning.

TypingMaster Satellite
Add Further Training to your Daily Work

TypingMaster Satellite is a unique learning assistant that integrates training into your everyday work. You can launch it after the typing course to hone your skills even further.

The Satellite analyzes your typing in other programs and identifies those keys and words that repeatedly cause difficulties. You can then train those difficult areas by completing customised exercises.

In addition the Satellite gathers statistics on your typing speed progress and reminds you to take short breaks to relax your arms.

Bite Size Exercises
Training to Fit Your Schedule

With TypingMaster Pro you can fit training even into the tightest schedule. The flexibility is based on the bite-size exercises that take only a few minutes to complete. Just 10 minutes is enough time for an effective learning session.
