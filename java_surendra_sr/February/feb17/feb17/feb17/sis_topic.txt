  Open Declaration   java.io.PrintWriter


Prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. 
This class implements all of the print methods found in PrintStream. 
It does not contain methods for writing raw bytes, for which a program
 should use un encoded byte streams. 

Unlike the PrintStream class, if automatic flushing is 
enabledit will be done only when one of the println, printf, or format methods is invoked, 
rather than whenever a newline characterhappens to be output. 
These methods use the platform's own notion of lineseparator rather than 
the newline character. 

Methods in this class never throw I/O exceptions, although some of
 itsconstructors may. The client may inquire as to whether any errors
 haveoccurred by invoking checkError().
