Element : load-on-startup
The load-on-startup element indicates that this servlet should be loaded (instantiated and have its init() called) 
 on the startup of the web application. 
 
 The optional contents of these element must be an integer indicating the 
 order in which the servlet should be loaded.


 If the value is a negative integer, or the element is not present, the 
 container is free to load the servlet whenever it chooses. If the value is a positive integer or 0, the container must 
 load and initialize the servlet as the application is deployed. 
 
 
 The container must guarantee that servlets marked 
 with lower integers are loaded before servlets marked with higher integers. 
 
 The container may choose the order 
 of loading of servlets with the same load-on-start-up value.
